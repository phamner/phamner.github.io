As I am dealing with concerns in modern day analytics by working at Snowflake, I'm interested in meeting with sharp minds within Data Architecture, Big Data, AI/ML & Analytics to exchange ideas and concerns. 

Feel free to contact me if you are experiencing:
- Slow reporting or trouble meeting SLAs
- Concurrency slowdowns (slow performance when there are simultaneous workloads/users)
- High cost of database/data warehouse and overhead management
- Complexity/issues handling and analyzing semi-structured data (i.e. JSON, Avro, Parquet, etc.)
- Large number of technologies in analytics stack/data pipeline
- Scaling limits to meet changing data demands
